# alt-tufte

This is a version of [tufte-memo](https://github.com/nogula/tufte-memo) that
tweaks it in some minor, but significant ways. It uses `a4` rather than
`us-letter`, different choice of fonts and the internal units are `em` or `mm`.
However, it's a WIP! It will eventually become its own project, probably.
